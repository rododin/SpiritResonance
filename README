The Idea
========

The idea of the project is resonance produced by common prayers allowing to increase the power of spirit efforts and will.
Believers know a common prayer gives much higher effect compared with the alone one.
So, the main goal of the project is synchronization of the prayers.
We do that using the idea of karaoke.
I.e. we start a prayer every 10 minutes, the words are highlighted like in karaoke songs, so the people are able to read the prayer synchronously.
Of course we'll provide many prayers with time, incl. e.g. complete series of morning and evening prayers.
We'll extend the idea using recorded and live sound, and even video.
We plan to provide appropriate web site customizations for many confessions and religions.
We hope the idea will work for all people and will make the people better!
